                As a member of the quality assurance team at Lunar Client, my job was to test and quality check all new features that was being added to the client. Lunar Client is a client for Minecraft, with several mods to improve the experience and gameplay. It is also the biggest client in the world, which is why our job is important.

                    In addition to testing the client, I have recently been promoted within the team, giving me more responsibility such as updating the bug tracking site with new bugs reported by the team. I am also responsible for verifying bug reports of newer members of the team, to then add these to the bug tracker.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, I also receive bug reports from the community, which we as a team check to see if they can be reproduced in controlled environments, and if they can, we add them to the bug tracker.

                As a teaching assistant, my role was to lead group sessions where other students could ask for help with various problems related to the course. I also acted as a liaison between the students and the lecturer, allowing us to raise issues or provide feedback during our weekly meetings with the lecturer.

                    In addition to this, I assessed student assignments, reviewing their work and providing feedback on what they did well and what could be improved for future submissions. The course itself was an introduction to programming, with all work conducted using Python. This role gave me valuable experience in teamwork, debugging, programming, time management, problem-solving, and more
